# Spatial-Analysis-of-Unhealthy-Food-Consumption-in-Ghana
### Project Overview
This project applies Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze and visualize spatial patterns in public health indicators across Ghana, with a focus on unhealthy food consumption among children aged 6–23 months. Using ArcGIS for spatial analysis, the project transforms complex geographic and health data into clear, interpretable maps that support public health research, policy planning, and targeted interventions.

### Tools & Technologies
ArcGIS

Microsoft Excel (data cleaning & preparation)

Administrative boundary shapefiles (Ghana)

Public health and nutrition survey data (secondary data)

### Data Description
The project uses spatial and attribute data including:
National and regional administrative boundaries of Ghana

Health and nutrition indicators aggregated at the regional and district levels

Study site classification data (study vs non-study districts)

All datasets were cleaned, standardized, and joined using unique geographic identifiers

### Spatial Analysis & Mapping Workflow
#### 1. Data Exploration
Examined attribute tables for missing values and inconsistencies

Verified coordinate systems and spatial alignment

Reviewed regional variations in health indicators

#### 2. Spatial Data Processing (ArcGIS)
The following GIS operations were performed:
Attribute joins between health data and boundary shapefiles

Data reclassification and normalization

Choropleth mapping using graduated color symbology

Spatial aggregation at regional and district levels

#### 3. Thematic Mapping Outputs
Two key map products were generated:
National Choropleth Map

Displays spatial distribution of unhealthy food consumption among children aged 6–23 months across Ghana

District-Level Study Site Map (Western Region)

Differentiates study and non-study districts

Supports transparent and evidence-based site selection
### Key Insights & Findings
Unhealthy food consumption shows strong regional variation, with higher prevalence in parts of southern Ghana

Coastal and urbanized regions demonstrate greater exposure to unhealthy food environments

National spatial patterns informed the selection of focused study sites within the Western Region

### Applications & Use Cases
Public health intervention planning

Policy prioritization and resource allocation

Research study design and site selection

NGO and development project planning
### Recommendations
Based on the spatial patterns observed:
Target High-Risk Regions

GIS maps can guide nutrition interventions toward regions with elevated unhealthy food consumption

Use GIS for Evidence-Based Sampling

Spatial analysis strengthens transparency and justification in selecting study and control sites

Integrate GIS into Monitoring Systems

Choropleth maps can be updated over time to monitor intervention impact
### Future Work
Finer-scale (community-level) spatial analysis

Integration of socioeconomic and environmental covariates

Time-series mapping for trend analysis

Interactive web mapping (ArcGIS Online / StoryMaps)
